# Autonomous-Mobile-Robotics-Project

Turtlebot robot patrols around a room and identifies coloured cones.
If the cones are at the robots sight, the robot goes towards the cones and spins in a 360 degrees angle to show the cone has been found and print out the colour of the cone. Then the robot returns back to the last patrol point and continues around the room until all the patrol locations are completed.

The project is written in python and uses tools such as ROS Programming, Sypder, Gazebo and Turtlebot robot.

This image shows an example of one of the simulated rooms that the Turtlebot will patrol in, however does not include the coloured cones.
